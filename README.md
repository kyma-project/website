# Website

## Overview

This repository contains website source for [`kyma-project.io`](https://kyma-project.io). It uses [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for static site generation.

> **NOTE:** The description of the application configuration, the project structure, the architecture, and other project-specific details are located in the [`docs`](./docs/README.md) directory.

## Prerequisites

Use the following tools to set up the project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Usage

To build production ready website, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

## Development

### Install dependencies

To install all dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

### Launch website locally

In order to launch the development server with hot reloading functionality, run the following command:

```
npm run develop
```

////unless npm run develop is really enough and by running this command I have kyma-project.io on local host with blog posts and documentation in it and I can start development with nice hot reload - yes it was for me
