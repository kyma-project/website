title: Use Kyma CLI
type: Details
---

Kyma CLI comes with a set of commands, each of which has its own specific set of flags. Use them to provision the cluster locally or using a chosen cloud provider, install, and test Kyma. 

For the commands and flags to work, they need to follow this syntax:

```bash
kyma {COMMAND} {FLAGS}
```

- **{COMMAND}** specifies the operation you want to perform, such as provisioning the cluster or installing Kyma.
- **{FLAGS}** specifies optional flags you can use to enrich your command.

See the example:

```bash
kyma install -s latest
```

>**TIP:** Documentation for particular commands is generated automatically with the code. See [the full list of commands and flags](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli/tree/master/docs/gen-docs).
