I'm part of the Kyma team working on Istio and API Gateway features. In this blog post, we would like to introduce the highly requested configuration support in Kyma Istio for forwarding an external client IP address to destination workloads. Read on learn more details about this improvement and see how to configure it.

## Background

Many applications need to know the client IP address of an originating request to behave properly. Usual use-cases include workloads that require the client IP address to restrict their access. The ability to provide client attributes to services has long been a staple of reverse proxies. To forward client attributes to destination workloads, proxies use the `X-Forwarded-For` (XFF) header. For more information on XFF, see the [IETFâ€™s RFC documentaion](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239) and [Envoy documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#x-forwarded-for).

Until now, managed Kyma Istio installation did not allow configuring Istio Service Mesh in such a way, that client attributes could be forwarded to the destination workloads. For managed Kyma installations, changes applied to the Istio Service Mesh configuration directly by the user were reset to the default settings by Kyma Reconciler.

## Solution

In order to provide a simplified and reliable way for applying changes to Istio Service Mesh, we introduced the Kyma Istio Custom Resource (CR). This improvement adds another layer of configuration abstraction for the user and provides us with the possibility of utilizing the Kubernetes controller pattern in the future.

Applications rely on reverse proxies to forward the client IP address in a request via the XFF header. However, due to the variety of network topologies, the user must specify a new configuration property `numTrustedProxies` to the number of trusted proxies deployed in front of the Istio gateway proxy, so that the client address can be extracted correctly. The configuration can be set globally for all of the gateway workloads in Kyma Istio CR. Here's an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: Istio
metadata:
  name: istio-operator
  namespace: kyma-system
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: istio-operator
spec:
  config:
    numTrustedProxies: 2
```

You may take a look at the [Kyma Istio CR reference documentation](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/05-technical-reference/00-custom-resources/oper-01-istio/) for further details.

## Example

1. Configure Kyma Istio with the newly introduced `numTrustedProxies` property in the CR.

- Check if the Istio CR exists, with:

```bash
kubectl get istios -n kyma-system
```

> **NOTE:** There must be only **one** Kyma Istio CR in the cluster.

- If the CR does not exist already, you must create it with a specified `numTrustedProxies` value:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: operator.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: Istio
metadata:
  name: istio-operator
  namespace: kyma-system
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: istio-operator
spec:
  config:
    numTrustedProxies: 2
EOF
```

- Otherwise you may adapt the value of the `numTrustedProxies` with:

```bash
kubectl patch istios/istio-operator -n kyma-system --type merge -p '{"spec":{"config":{"numTrustedProxies": 2}}}'
```

2. Allow Kyma Istio Reconciler to apply the changes to Istio ConfigMap. It runs every minute. You may check if `numTrustedProxies` was applied within Istio ConfigMap with:

```bash
kubectl get configmap -n istio-system istio --output=jsonpath={.data} | jq '.mesh'
```

3. Restart Istio Ingress Gateway for the configuration to take effect:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
```

4. Expose and secure the `httpbin` workload as described in our [Expose and secure a workload with Istio](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/03-tutorials/00-api-exposure/apix-07-expose-and-secure-workload-istio/) developer tutorial.


5. Run the following curl command to simulate a request with proxy addresses in the XFF header:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization:Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "X-Forwarded-For: 98.1.2.3" "https://httpbin.$DOMAIN_TO_EXPOSE_WORKLOADS/get?show_env=true"
{
  "args": {
    "show_env": "true"
  },
  "headers": {
    "Accept": ...,
    "Host": ...,
    "User-Agent": ...,
    "X-B3-Parentspanid": ...,
    "X-B3-Sampled": ...,
    "X-B3-Spanid": ...,
    "X-B3-Traceid": ...,
    "X-Envoy-Attempt-Count": ...,
    "X-Envoy-External-Address": "72.9.5.6",
    "X-Forwarded-Client-Cert": ...,
    "X-Forwarded-For": "56.5.6.7,72.9.5.6,98.1.2.3,10.180.0.3",
    "X-Forwarded-Host": ...,
    "X-Forwarded-Proto": ...,
    "X-Request-Id": ...
  },
  "origin": "56.5.6.7,72.9.5.6,98.1.2.3,10.180.0.3",
  "url": ...
}
```

> **NOTE:** In the above example Istio Ingress Gateway resolved to 10.180.0.3. This will not be the case in your environment.

The above output shows the request headers that the `httpbin` workload received. 
When the Istio gateway receives a request, it sets the `X-Envoy-External-Address` header to the second to last address in the XFF header from your curl command (`numTrustedProxies`: 2). Additionally, the gateway appends its own IP to the XFF header before forwarding it to the `httpbin` workload.

The workload then should consider the `X-Envoy-External-Address` IP address as the client IP.
