Salve!
If you're wondering why the salutation in Latin and why we're using the _lingua franca_ at the moment:
after we left Berlin, we decided to stop exploration for just a little while and land on this unnamed island to patch our boat a bit and boost our security. This release is not big, but it's an important one, as it brings you upgraded Istio and updated Ory stack.
