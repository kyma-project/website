Recently we released a new view in our website called <a href="/roadmap" target="_blank">Roadmap</a> that's main purpose is to raise transparency of project direction and to enable contribution of the features.

## Choosing the right tool

Choosing the right open source tool is not easy. There are many different factors you need to take into account before you make the right decision. Luckily internet if full of ideas and suggestions on how to do that, like article [How to Choose the Best Open Source Software](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-choose-the-best-open-source-software-b1cbbe4f6398).

> Remember that the amount of commits, issues, and pull-requests (PRs) can be a signal of investment and commitment to a project.

Those articles are very helpful. When I started using open source projects as my dependencies I quickly realized that not all of them are trustworthy and deserve investment. Unfortunately, these guides and articles always focus on me, on a person that performs research. It is always me that needs to do the review, search for information, check out contributors and review backlog. This is ok if I have to choose a small library for parsing YAML in the browser. Things are getting more complicated though when you have to choose a solution on which you will run or extend your business applications. The size and complexity prevent you from good research. The amount of PRs and issues clearly indicated a huge investment in the project, but can you guess what is coming next, how it evolves? If you have to take a strategic decision, you need to know what is the direction, vision and future development plans of a given solution.

We wanted to ease the things for the Kyma community. We identified in Kyma different capabilities it has and shared our goal and visions for each. Thanks to such approach each capability has its own roadmap but created in sync with other capabilities, so it creates one overview of all the things that are going to happen in Kyma in the short and long term. We combined all in one view 
called <a href="/roadmap" target="_blank">Roadmap</a>.

Thanks to this view you can clearly identify areas of Kyma that are the most important for you and see if planned development goes the direction you expect. If something is not the way you expected you can always share with us your opinion on our [Core SIG meetings](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/sig-and-wg/sig-core), especially if you notice we are not fully transparent for a specific capability and its roadmap is not properly maintained. The other option to make things better is to join us and contribute.

## Easier contribution

Being an open source user for a few years already, I noticed on many different channels situation where people want to start a contribution to a project, but they do not know what they could contribute. It is quite common that people ask `I want to contribute to this project, what feature would be the most interesting for people`. This is another reason why we worked on this new view on our website. We don't want to search and invent ideas for contribution, all that you need is there, in our roadmap. You can just pick the feature that is set for future development and go forward with proposal and implementation. This way you know that you contribute something that is important for Kyma and its future.
