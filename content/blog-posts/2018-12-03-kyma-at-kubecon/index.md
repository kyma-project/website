As you may already know, the [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/) conference, known among the whole Kubernetes and CNCF community, is taking place in Seattle on December 10. 
This one-liner intro already clarifies why we, the Kyma people, want to be there too. Our main focus is:
- To meet you, show you what Kyma is, and answer all your questions
- Meet with other communities. For now, we are planning to meet with the Kubernetes' Testing SIG and the Service Catalog SIG and talk about our future contributions.

<!-- overview -->

These Kyma experts are comming:
- Ralf Hofmann, our Product Lead
- Krassimir Semerdzhiev, our Strategist 
- Ahmed Abdalla, [the leader of the Kyma's Core SIG](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/sig-and-wg/sig-core) and our Lead Product Engineer
- Piotr Kopczynski, [the leader of the Kyma's Core SIG](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/sig-and-wg/sig-core) and the owner of the Kyma's Service Catalog capability
- Lukasz Gornicki, [the leader of the Kyma's Core SIG](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/sig-and-wg/sig-core) and the owner of the Kyma's Core and Supporting capability

The easiest way to talk to us before the event is to do it through [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/kyma-community/shared_invite/enQtNDAwNzE4Mjk2NDE3LTJhOTlmZjM5YzkwNmEzNmY3ZjE2MTU2OTMxOGE4ZDM0MmU4ZWRkZGJiODgzNmRmMTYxMDYwNjZiMDAwMTA2OWM).
During the event, you can easily find all Kyma members that travel to Seattle at the SAP booth. Why SAP? Kyma was donated to the open-source community a few months ago by [SAP](/blog/introducing-project-kyma). Stop by and find us at the SAP booth together with another great Kubernetes-native project called [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/).
