Recently we released a new view in our website called <a href="/roadmap" target="_blank">Roadmap</a> that's main purpose is to raise transparency of project direction and to enable contribution of the features.

<!-- overview -->

Choosing right open source tool is not easy. There are many different factors you need to take into account before you make the decision. This is getting even more complicated when you have to choose solution as large as Kyma. It is a strategic decision, that is why you need to be sure what is its direction, vision and how it is going to be developed.

- Transparency
- Easier contribute -> no need for searching and inventing ideas for contribution, all is already on the roadmap, just pick what is the moste usefull for you
