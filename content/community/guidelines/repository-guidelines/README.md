Repository guidelines include:

- The [instruction](#new-repository-settings-new-repository-settings) that lists recommended settings for a new repository in the `kyma-project` and `kyma-incubator` organizations.
- The content description of the [`repository-template`](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/main/guidelines/repository-guidelines/repository-template) folder that provides the structure of an exemplary Kyma repository. Use it whenever you create a new repository within Kyma.
