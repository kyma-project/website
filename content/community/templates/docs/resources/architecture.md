>This is a template for the **Architecture** document type that describes in detail the architecture of a given Kyma component. This document should include, among others, the diagram which illustrates all components and sub-components involved, a description of the functions they perform, and a step-by-step description of the workflow.
>
>  In the document:
> * Provide a [diagram](../../content-guidelines/diagrams.md) which illustrates the workflow of a given component. The diagram is a **mandatory** element of this document.
> * Describe all components and sub-components involved in the workflow together with their functions.
> * Use an ordered list to describe a step-by-step workflow.
> * Use sections if the document does not describe any workflow but the overall arrangement of the components and sub-components. In this case, each component should be described in a separate section. Use H2 (##) for sections and H3 (###) for sub-sections. Do not use headings smaller than H3 as they do not display well on the UI.
> * Follow the `02-{00}-{component-name}.md` convention to name the document.
> * In the metadata section, follow the `{Component name} architecture` convention for the `title` if there are more than one Architecture document in a repository. If there is only one document of a certain type, remove the `type` metadata completely so that the document displays well on the UI.

> For reference, see the existing **Architecture** document for the [Service Catalog](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/service-catalog/#architecture-architecture).
