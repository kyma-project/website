> This is a template for the **Overview** document type that introduces a given Kyma component.
>
>  In the document:
> * Describe the component in general.
> * Provide its purpose and function.
> * Be short but descriptive.
> * Avoid headings. If you want to provide more details, create a separate **Details** document.
> * Follow the `01-{00}-{component-name}.md` convention to name the document.
> * In the metadata section, follow the `{Component name} overview` convention for the `title` if there are more than one Overview document in a repository. If there is only one document of a certain type, remove the `type` metadata completely so that the document displays well on the UI.
>
> For reference, see the existing **Overview** document for the [Application Connector](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/application-connector/#overview-overview).
