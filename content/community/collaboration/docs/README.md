The Kyma community collaborates through Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and Working Groups (WGs). They are platforms to meet other community members, exchange information on Kyma, provide feedback, raise interest, ask questions, and learn about the product. Additionally, SIGs and WGs facilitate technical discussions, proposals, and contributions, and ensure Kyma is a welcoming community for all contributors.
