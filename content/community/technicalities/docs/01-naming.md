The file contains the official rules for naming objects in Kyma.

## Naming and structure guidelines

### General names

The product is called Kyma. Use `kyma` if uppercase letters are not available or not typical in a specific context.

### Source code repositories

Place all repositories belonging to the product under the [Kyma](https://github.com/kyma-project) location on GitHub.
Do not use Kyma-related prefixes, such as `kyma-`, in the repository names.
Name the repository using lowercase, and separate words with dashes, for example `catalog-service-api`.
