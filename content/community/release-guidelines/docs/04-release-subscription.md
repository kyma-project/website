GitHub offers an option to subscribe to email notifications on new releases in repositories. To learn how to watch the given repository only for the releases, read [this](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-releases-for-a-repository/) official GitHub article.

Alternatively, use free online tools, such as [CodeRelease.io](https://coderelease.io/), [GitPunch](https://gitpunch.com/), or [releases](https://releases.netlify.com/), to get e-mail notifications when the GitHub projects release a new version in the GitHub repositories that you watched and starred.
