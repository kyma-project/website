## Contribution rules

Before you start contributing, read our [Code of Conduct](/contributing/#code-of-conduct-code-of-conduct) and learn about our [working model](/governance/#kyma-working-model-kyma-working-model) to understand the way Kyma community works. Get familiar with the [contributing rules](/contributing/#contributing-rules-contributing-rules), recommended [Git workflow](/contributing/#git-wokflow-git-wokflow), and [issues workflow](/governance/#issues-workflow-issues-workflow) we use in Kyma so you can apply them later in practice as an active contributor.

## Guidelines

Follow guidelines for writing [content](/guidelines/content/) and [code](/guidelines/technicalities/). See how to create a [new repository](/guidelines/repository/) or a [new release](/guidelines/release/), and use [templates](/guidelines/templates/) for various document types.

## Bugs & features

Create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project) to report a bug or request a feature. Go to the given repository's issue tracker and raise an issue using one of the available templates. The owners of the repository will review your issue and provide you with their feedback. If you are not certain which repository your issue refers to, open it in the [`kyma`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) repository.

## Special Interest Groups & Working Groups
