      " is a platform for extending applications with serverless functions and microservices. It provides a selection of cloud-native projects glued together to make it easier to write extensions and manage them in the production environment.",
      "You can create microservices or serverless functions which react to particular Events or calls to your application's API and implement the business logic you just created. You can always limit the time spent on coding and simply consume the in-built cloud services from the Service Catalog portfolio, exposed by open service brokers from such cloud providers as GCP, Azure, and AWS."
