Authentication is covered by istio policy which relies on id tokens validation. API Gateway lacks the feature of applying authorization to an exposed API. Internal communication can be covered with istio RBAC rules but it cannot be applied for incoming requests from external services/applications. For developers creating for example lambdas and exposing them to the public internet, it is beneficial to allow service to service communication with autn and authz in place. Moreover, it's not possible to fetch token in service to service without the context of the user.\r\n\r\nSolutions to investigate :\r\n- OAuth2 server (https://github.com/ory/hydra)\r\n- OPA (https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)\r\n- Integration with istio one of the solutions\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reasons**\r\n\r\nEnrich API gateway functionality with authZ capabilities. Allow fetching tokens without the context of the user.\r\n\r\n**Attachments**\r\n\r\n\r\n",
