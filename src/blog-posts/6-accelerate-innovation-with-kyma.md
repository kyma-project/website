Is Tesla Model X still a car, or is it a smart device? This might sound like a silly question, as the Model X has all of the usual "car" traits: an engine, metal bodywork, rims, tires, etc. On paper, the Model X might look like yet another car, but its uniqueness, aside from the electric engine, of course, lies in the software innovation that Tesla brings to the market. The ability to update the onboard software over-the-air and bring new features and functionalities to a car is a key factor that attracts consumers to buy Teslas. This revolution shows that innovation, even in industries as old as car manufacturing, is an important and powerful tool that allows to penetrate the market faster. Many of the leading car manufacturers are still trying to catch up with Tesla's success. Businesses need to leverage new technologies, take on innovations and transform digitally to be competitive. Simply put - innovate or perish!

On our ongoing innovation journey, we have identified several challenges for companies that go through this process of digital transformation:

- **Heterogeneous Product Portfolio:** Single-vendor solutions are a thing of the past. (ref: https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives). Companies don't want to invest in a single vendor product stack. They need to have best of breed products. Heterogeneity is unavoidable, so software product companies need to be ready to embrace the diversity and be open to work hand in hand with the dreaded competition.

- **Monolithic deployment:** Monolithic applications can be great, but as the size grows, so does the complexity. This slows down the time to market, adds complexity to testing and shipping, complicates adding new features or extensions, and makes scaling difficult. Currently many of the best available products are still monolithic.

- **Cloud-native:** Companies are moving faster towards using cloud-native open source stacks for production (ref: https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/29/cncf-survey-use-of-cloud-native-technologies-in-production-has-grown-over-200-percent/). The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) describes "cloud-native" software as one that is container-packaged, dynamically orchestrated and managed, and microservice-architected. Building cloud-native solutions is not easy. It requires better inter-service communication, proper traceability of transactions across solutions, logging across several services and solutions, proper monitoring and operating hundreds of services.

- **The "need for speed":** Some of our customers say that "speed is the new ultimate currency". It's challenging to develop at a faster pace while facing the challenges of heterogeneity, monolithic deployment and trying to teach every developer in the organization the ways of cloud-native development.

Kyma has worked hard to overcome these challenges and support businesses throughout their digital transformation journey. Kyma is an open-source project designed natively on Kubernetes. It allows you to extend and customize cloud-based and on-premise enterprise applications in a quick and modern way, using serverless computing and microservice architecture.

This way, Kyma enables businesses to:

- **Be open and extendable:** Using any Open Service Broker API specification-compatible service is a "plug and play" affair which gives you access to a catalog of reusable, integrated services for developers, both in-house and 3rd party. This allows you to use business services and technical backing services from different vendors to extend your existing applications.

- **Be seamlessly connected:** The simplified approach to secure connectivity between systems allows seamless API and event integration of the existing applications. You can manage and orchestrate existing applications to build common extension solution even in heterogeneous landscapes. A single connection gives you multiple possibilities.

- **Use any programming language:** Develop microservices or serverless functions using any programming language and enjoy more hiring options as a result.

- **Bring speed and agility:** Businesses don't have to wait for months or years to deliver specific scenarios or use cases. With Kyma the delivery times are faster (within days or weeks) and the entire process costs less.

- **Accelerate innovation:** In many cases innovation starts as a test or a trail. In such cases, both speed and low cost are of great importance. Kyma enables businesses to start working on their solutions immediately instead of finding the right technology and integration options first and brings the startup culture to enterprises.

Kyma is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project) and open for developers to contribute. It allows businesses to build and advance products and services they offer to make them even better on the marketplace. This empowers companies to stand out, to increase revenue, and to be more like Tesla.
