title: "Kyma at KubeCon"
---

Next week, on December 10th, in Seattle, there is the [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2018/) conference known among the whole Kubernetes and CNCF community. 
This one-liner intro kind of already clarifies why we, Kyma people, want to be there too. Our main focus is:
- To meet you, show you what Kyma is and answer all your questions
- Meet with other communities. So far we plan to meet with Kubernetes' Testing SIG and Service Catalog SIG about our future contributions.

These Kyma experts are comming:
- Ralf Hofmann, our Product Lead
- Krassimir Semerdzhiev, our Strategist 
- Ahmed Abdalla, lead of Kyma's Core SIG and our Engineering Lead
- Piotr Kopczynski, lead of Kyma's Core SIG and the owner of Kyma's Service Catalog capability
- Lukasz Gornicki, lead of Kyma's Core SIG and the owner of Kyma's Core and Supporting capability

The easiest way to talk to us before the event is to do it through [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/kyma-community/shared_invite/enQtNDAwNzE4Mjk2NDE3LTJhOTlmZjM5YzkwNmEzNmY3ZjE2MTU2OTMxOGE4ZDM0MmU4ZWRkZGJiODgzNmRmMTYxMDYwNjZiMDAwMTA2OWM).
During the event, you can easily find all Kyma members that travel to Seattle at the SAP booth. Why SAP? Kyma was donated to open source community few months ago by [SAP](/blog/introducing-project-kyma). Therefore at the moment it is much easier for us to be there at SAP booth together with another great Kubernetes native project called [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/).
