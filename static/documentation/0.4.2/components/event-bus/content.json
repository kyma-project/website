Define triggers by creating the Subscription custom resource in which you register with the Event Bus to forward the Events of a particular type, such as <code>order-created</code>, to your lambda or a service. Whenever the <code>order-created</code> Event comes in, the Event Bus consumes it by saving it in NATS Streaming and Persistence, and sends it to the correct receiver specified in the Subscription definition.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Event Bus creates a separate Event Trigger for each Subscription.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before the Event Bus forwards the Event to the receiver, the sub-validator performs a security check to verify the permissions for this Event in a given Environment. It reads all new Subscription resources and refers to the EventActivation resource to check whether a particular Event type is enabled in a given Environment. If the Event is enabled for an Environment, it updates the Subscription resource with the information.
