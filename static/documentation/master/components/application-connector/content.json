No matter if you want to integrate an on-premise or a cloud system, the integration process doesn&#39;t change, which allows to avoid any configuration or network-related problems.</p>\n<p>The external solution you connect to Kyma using the AC is represented as an Application (App). There is always a one-to-one relationship between a connected solution and an App, which helps to ensure the highest level of security and separation. This means that you must create five separate Apps in your cluster to connect five different external solutions and use their APIs and Event catalogs in Kyma.</p>\n<p>The AC gives you this functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manages the lifecycle of Apps.</li>\n<li>Establishes a secure connection and generates the client certificate used by the connected external solution.</li>\n<li>Registers the APIs and the Event catalogs of the connected external solution.</li>\n<li>Delivers the Events from the connected external solution to the Kyma Event Bus.</li>\n<li>Proxies calls sent from Kyma to external APIs registered by the connected external solution.</li>\n<li>Allows to map an App to a Kyma Namespace and use its registered APIs and Event catalogs in the context of that Namespace.</li>\n<li>Integrates the registered APIs and Event catalogs with the Kyma Service Catalog.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the AC components scale independently, which allows to adjust it to fit the needs of the implementation built using Kyma.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To learn more about the concept of Namespaces in Kyma, read <a href=\"/docs/root/kyma#details-namespaces\">this</a> document.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

For example, to reach the Gateway for the <code>user-custom</code> App, use this URL: <code>gateway.servicemanager.cluster.kyma.cx/user-custom</code>. The Nginx Ingress Controller secures the endpoint with certificate validation. Each call must include a valid client certificate which is App-specific.</p>\n<h2 id=\"connector-service\">Connector Service</h2>\n<p>The Connector Service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Handles the exchange of client certificates for a given RE.</li>\n<li>Provides the Application Registry and Event Service endpoints.</li>\n<li>Signs client certificates using the server side certificate stored in Kubernetes Secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"application-registry\">Application Registry</h2>\n<p>The Application Registry stores all registered APIs and Event Catalog exposed by a connected external solution. The APIs and Event catalogs metadata are stored in the <a href=\"#custom-resource-application\">Application</a> custom resource.\nThe system creates a new Kubernetes service for each registered API. Additionally, a new Service Classes is registered in the Service Catalog.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Using the Application Registry, you can register an API along with its OAuth or Basic Authentication credentials. The credentials are stored in a Kubernetes Secret.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"event-service\">Event Service</h2>\n<p>The Event Service sends Events to the Kyma Event Bus and enriches the Events with metadata that indicates the source of the Event.\nThis allows routing the Events to lambda functions and services based on their source App.</p>\n<h2 id=\"application\">Application</h2>\n<p>An App represents an external solution connected to Kyma. It handles the integration with other components, such as the Service Catalog or the Event Bus.\nUsing the components of the Application Connector, the App creates a coherent identity for a connected external solution and ensures its separation.\nAll Apps are created through the Application custom resource, which also stores all of the relevant metadata. You can map an App to many Kyma Namespaces and use the APIs and the Event Catalogs of the connected external solution within their context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"application-broker\">Application Broker</h2>\n<p>The Application Broker (AB) watches all <a href=\"#custom-resource-application\">Application</a> custom resources. These custom resources contain definitions of external solutions’ APIs and Events. The AB exposes those APIs and Events definitions as ServiceClasses to the Service Catalog. When the list of remote ServiceClasses is available in the Service Catalog, you can create an ApplicationMapping, provision those ServiceClasses, and enable them for Kyma services. This allows you to extend the functionality of existing systems.</p>\n<p>The AB implements the <a href=\"https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Service Broker API</a>. For more details about Service Brokers, see <a href=\"/docs/components/helm-broker#overview-service-brokers\">this</a> documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"application-operator\">Application Operator</h2>\n<p>The operator listens for creating or deleting the Application custom resources and acts accordingly, either provisioning or de-provisioning an instance of Application Proxy and Event Service for every custom resource.         </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Every Application custom resource corresponds to a single App to which you can connect an external solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"application-proxy\">Application Proxy</h2>\n<p>The Application Proxy is an intermediary component between a lambda function or a service and an external API registered with the Application Registry. It can call services secured with the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617\" target=\"_blank\">Basic Authentication</a> mechanism, acquire OAuth tokens, and call OAuth-secured APIs.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"access-service\">Access Service</h2>\n<p>The Access Service exposes the Application Proxy and manages the access from the Lambda functions and services deployed in Kyma to the external APIs over the Application Proxy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"minio-bucket\">Minio bucket</h2>\n<p>The Minio bucket stores the documentation of the connected external solution&#39;s registered APIs and Event catalogs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-secret\">Kubernetes Secret</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes Secret is a Kubernetes object which stores sensitive data, such as the OAuth credentials.</p>\n"
