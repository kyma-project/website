      "source": "<p>The Application Connector (AC) is a proprietary Kyma implementation that allows you to connect with external solutions. No matter if you want to integrate an on-premise or a cloud system, the integration process doesn&#39;t change, which allows to avoid any configuration and network-related problems.</p>\n<p>The external solution you connect to Kyma using the AC is represented as a Remote Environment (RE). There is always a one-to-one relationship between a connected solution and a Kyma RE, which helps to ensure the highest level of security and separation. This means that you must create five separate REs in your cluster to connect five different external solutions and use their APIs and Event catalogs in Kyma.</p>\n<p>The AC gives you the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manages the lifecycle of REs.</li>\n<li>Establishes a secure connection and generates the client certificate used by the connected external solution.</li>\n<li>Registers the APIs and the Event catalogs of the connected external solution.</li>\n<li>Delivers the Events from the connected external solution to the Kyma Event Bus.</li>\n<li>Proxies calls sent from Kyma to external APIs registered by the connected external solution.</li>\n<li>Allows to map a RE to a Kyma Environment and use its registered APIs and Event catalogs in the context of that Environment.</li>\n<li>Integrates the registered APIs and Event catalogs with the Kyma Service Catalog.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the AC components scale independently, which allows to adjust it to fit the needs of the implementation built using Kyma.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To learn more about the Environments in Kyma, read the <strong>Environments</strong> document in the <strong>Kyma</strong> documentation topic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

For example, to reach the Gateway for the <code>ec-default</code> Remote Environment, use this URL: <code>gateway.servicemanager.cluster.kyma.cx/ec-default</code>. The Nginx Ingress Controller secures the endpoint with certificate validation. Each call must include a valid client certificate which is Remote Environment-specific.</p>\n<h2 id=\"connector-service\">Connector Service</h2>\n<p>The Connector Service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Handles the exchange of client certificates for a given RE.</li>\n<li>Provides the Metadata Service and Event Service endpoints.</li>\n<li>Signs client certificates using the server side certificate stored in Kubernetes Secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"metadata-service\">Metadata Service</h2>\n<p>The Metadata Service stores all registered APIs and Event Catalog exposed by a connected external solution. The APIs and Event catalogs metadata are stored in RemoteEnvironment Custom Resource.\nThe system creates a new Kubernetes service for each registered API. Additionally, a new Service Classes is registered in the Service Catalog.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Using the Metadata Service, you can register an API along with its OAuth credentials. The credentials are stored in a Kubernetes Secret.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"event-service\">Event Service</h2>\n<p>The Event Service sends events to the Kyma Event Bus and enriches the events with metadata that indicates the source of the Event.\nThis allows to route the events to Lambda functions and Services based on their source Remote Environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remote-environment\">Remote Environment</h2>\n<p>A Remote Environment (RE) represents an external solution connected to Kyma. It handles the integration with other components, such as the Service Catalog or the Event Bus.\nUsing the components of the Application Connector, the RE creates a coherent identity for a connected external solution and ensures its separation.\nAll REs are created through the RemoteEnvironment Custom Resource, which also stores all of the relevant metadata. You can map a RE to many Kyma Environments and use the APIs and the Event Catalogs of the connected external solution within their context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remote-environment-controller\">Remote Environment controller</h2>\n<p>The controller listens for creating or deleting the RemoteEnvironment Custom Resources and acts accordingly, either provisioning or de-provisioning an instance of Proxy Service and Event Service for every Custom Resource.         </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Every RemoteEnvironment Custom Resource corresponds to a single RE to which you can connect an external solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"proxy-service\">Proxy Service</h2>\n<p>The Proxy Service is an intermediary component between a lambda function or a service and an external API registered with the Metadata Service. It acts as a proxy and can acquire OAuth tokens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"access-service\">Access Service</h2>\n<p>The Access Service exposes the Proxy Service and manages the access from the Lambda functions and services deployed in Kyma to the external APIs over the Proxy Service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"minio-bucket\">Minio bucket</h2>\n<p>The Minio bucket stores the documentation of the connected external solution&#39;s registered APIs and Event catalogs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-secret\">Kubernetes Secret</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes Secret is a Kubernetes object which stores sensitive data, such as the OAuth credentials.</p>\n"

In this way, the traffic is fully encrypted and the client has a valid identity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disable-ssl-certificate-verification\">Disable SSL certificate verification</h2>\n<p>You can disable the SSL certificate verification in the communication between Kyma and a Remote Environment to allow Kyma to send requests and data to an unsecured Remote Environment.
