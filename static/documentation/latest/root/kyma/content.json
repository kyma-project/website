      "source": "<p>One might ask what makes Kyma so special since it consists in 90% of open-source, cloud-native projects available to everyone, such as Istio, NATS, Kubeless, and Prometheus. Its uniqueness lies in the &quot;glue&quot; that holds these components together. Kyma collects those cutting-edge solutions in one place and combines them with the 10% of in-house developed features that allow you to create application extensions, and connect services easily and intuitively.</p>\n<p>Kyma allows you to extend and customize the functionality of your products in a quick and modern way, using serverless computing and microservice architecture. The extensions and customizations you create are decoupled from the core applications, which means that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deployments are quick.</li>\n<li>Scaling is independent from the core applications.</li>\n<li>The changes you make can be easily reverted without causing downtime of the production system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last but not least, Kyma is highly cost-efficient. All Kyma native components and the connected open-source tools are written in Go. It ensures low memory consumption and reduced maintenance costs compared to applications written in other programming languages such as Java.</p>\n"

Other planned changes concerning Kyma and Knative cooperation involve providing configuration options to allow Istio deployed with Knative to work on Kyma, and extracting Kyma eventing to fully integrate it with Knative eventing. The eventing integration will provide more flexibility on deciding which messaging implementation to use (NATS, Kafka, or any other).</p>\n"

Using the Service Catalog, you can provision new services in the\nKyma <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Kubernetes</a> cluster and create bindings between the provisioned service and an application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"service-brokers\">Service Brokers</h2>\n<p>Service Brokers are <a href=\"https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Service Broker API</a>-compatible servers that manage the lifecycle of one or more services. Each Service Broker registered in Kyma presents the services it offers to the Service Catalog. You can provision these services on a cluster level through the Service Catalog. Out of the box, Kyma comes with three Service Brokers.\nYou can register more <a href=\"https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Service Broker API</a>-compatible Service Brokers in Kyma and provision the services they offer using the Service Catalog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"application-connector\">Application Connector</h2>\n<p>The Application Connector is a proprietary Kyma solution. This endpoint is the Kyma side of the connection between Kyma and the external solutions. The Application Connector allows you to register the APIs and the Event Catalog, which lists all of the available events, of the connected solution. Additionally, the Application Connector proxies the calls from Kyma to external APIs in a secure way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"event-bus\">Event Bus</h2>\n<p>Kyma Event Bus receives Events from external solutions and triggers the business logic created with lambda functions and services in Kyma. The Event Bus is based on the <a href=\"https://nats.io/\" target=\"_blank\">NATS Streaming</a> open source messaging system for cloud-native applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"service-mesh\">Service Mesh</h2>\n<p>The Service Mesh is an infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication, proxying, service discovery, traceability, and security independent of the code of the services. Kyma uses the <a href=\"https://istio.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Istio</a> Service Mesh that enforces RBAC (Role Based Access Control) in the cluster. <a href=\"https://github.com/coreos/dex\" target=\"_blank\">Dex</a> handles the identity management and identity provider integration. It allows you to integrate any <a href=\"https://openid.net/connect/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenID Connect</a>-compliant identity provider with Kyma.   </p>\n<h2 id=\"serverless\">Serverless</h2>\n<p>The Kyma Serverless component allows you to reduce the implementation and operation effort of an application to the absolute minimum. Kyma Serverless provides a platform to run lightweight functions in a cost-efficient and scalable way using JavaScript and Node.js. Kyma Serverless is built on the <a href=\"http://kubeless.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Kubeless</a> framework, which allows you to deploy lambda functions,\nand uses the <a href=\"https://nats.io/\" target=\"_blank\">NATS</a> messaging system that monitors business events and triggers functions accordingly.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"monitoring\">Monitoring</h2>\n<p>Kyma comes bundled with tools that give you the most accurate and up-to-date monitoring data.  <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Prometheus</a> open source monitoring and alerting toolkit provides this data, which is consumed by different add-ons, including <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grafana</a> for analytics and monitoring, and <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/\" target=\"_blank\">Alertmanager</a> for handling alerts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tracing\">Tracing</h2>\n<p>The tracing in Kyma uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/jaegertracing\" target=\"_blank\">Jaeger</a> distributed tracing system. Use it to analyze performance by scrutinizing the path of the requests sent to and from your service. This information helps you optimize the latency and performance of your solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"logging\">Logging</h2>\n<p>Logging in Kyma uses <a href=\"https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout\" target=\"_blank\">Logspout</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/oklog/oklog\" target=\"_blank\">OK Log</a>. Use a plaintext or a regular expression to fetch logs from pods using the OK Log UI.</p>\n"

Follow the deployment steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a Secret resource.</li>\n<li>Write your deployment file.</li>\n<li>Submit the file to the Kyma cluster.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"create-a-secret-for-your-private-registry\">Create a Secret for your private registry</h3>\n<p>A Secret resource passes your Docker registry credentials to the Kyma cluster in an encrypted form. For more information on Secrets, refer to the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/\" target=\"_blank\">Kubernetes documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>To create a Secret resource for your Docker registry, run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">kubectl create secret docker-registry {secret-name} --docker-server={registry FQN} --docker-username={user-name} --docker-password={password} --docker-email={registry-email} --namespace={namespace}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Refer to the following example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">kubectl create secret docker-registry docker-registry-secret --docker-server=myregistry:5000 --docker-username=root --docker-password=password --docker-email=example@github.com --namespace=production\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Secret is associated with a specific Namespace. In the example, the Namespace is <code>production</code>. However, you can modify the Secret to point to any desired Namespace.</p>\n<h3 id=\"write-your-deployment-file\">Write your deployment file</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Create the deployment file with the <code>.yml</code> extension and name it <code>deployment.yml</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Describe your deployment in the <code>.yml</code> file. Refer to the following example:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-yaml\">apiVersion: apps/v1beta2\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  namespace: production # {production/stage/qa}\n  name: my-deployment # Specify the deployment name.\n  annotations:\n    sidecar.istio.io/inject: true\nspec:\n  replicas: 3 # Specify your replica - how many instances you want from that deployment.\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: app-name # Specify the app label.
