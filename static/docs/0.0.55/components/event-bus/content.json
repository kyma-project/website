        "<p>Kyma Event Bus enables the integration of various external solutions with Kyma. The integration is achieved using the <code>publish-subscribe</code> messaging pattern that allows Kyma to receive business Events from different solutions, enrich them, and trigger business flows using lambdas or services defined in Kyma.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Event Bus is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server/releases\" target=\"_blank\">NATS Streaming</a> open source log-based streaming system for cloud-native applications, which is a brokered messaging middleware. The Event Bus provides <strong>at-least-once</strong> delivery guarantees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

        "<p>The following resources are involved in Event transfer and validation in Kyma:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>EventActivation</strong> is a custom resource controller that the Remote Environment Broker (REB) creates. Its purpose is to define Event availability in a given Environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>NATS Streaming</strong> is an open source, log-based streaming system that serves as a database allowing the Event Bus to store and transfer the Events on a large scale.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Persistence</strong> is a back-end storage volume for NATS Streaming that stores Events. When the Event flow fails, the Event Bus can resume the process using the Events saved in Persistence.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Publish</strong> is an internal Event Bus service that transfers the enriched Event from a given external solution to NATS Streaming.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Push</strong> is an application responsible for receiving Events from NATS Streaming in the Event Bus. Additionally, it delivers the validated Events to the lambda or the service, following the trigger from the Subscription custom resource. The Events are delivered to the lambda or the service through the Envoy proxy sidecar with mTLS enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Subscription</strong> is a custom resource that the lambda or service creator defines to subscribe a given lambda or a service to particular types of Events.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Sub-validator</strong> is a Kubernetes deployment. It updates the status of the Subscription custom resource with the EventActivation status. Depending on the status, <code>push</code> starts or stops delivering Events to the lambda or the service webhook.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"

Define triggers by creating the Subscription custom resource in which you register with the Event Bus to forward the Events of a particular type, such as <code>order-created</code>, to your lambda or a service. Whenever the <code>order-created</code> Event comes in, the Event Bus consumes it by saving it in NATS Streaming and Persistence, and sends it to the correct receiver specified in the Subscription definition.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Event Bus creates a separate Event Trigger for each Subscription.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before the Event Bus forwards the Event to the receiver, the sub-validator performs a security check to verify the permissions for this Event in a given Environment. It reads all new Subscription resources and refers to the EventActivation resource to check whether a particular Event type is enabled in a given Environment. If the Event is enabled for an Environment, it updates the Subscription resource with the information. Based on the information, <code>push</code> sends the Event to the lambda or the service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"validation-flow\">Validation flow</h3>\n<p>See the diagram and a step-by-step description of the Event verification process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/event-validation.png\" alt=\"Event validation process\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Kyma user defines a lambda or a service.</li>\n<li>Kyma user creates a Subscription custom resource.</li>\n<li>The sub-validator reads the new Subscription.</li>\n<li>The sub-validator refers to the EventActivation resource to check if the Event in the Subscription is activated for the given Environment.</li>\n<li>The sub-validator updates the Subscription resource accordingly.</li>\n</ol>\n"
